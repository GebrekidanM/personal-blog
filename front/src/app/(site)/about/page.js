            The Journey of a Problem Solver
          </h2>
          <p>
            My journey began not in a boardroom, but in the world of mechanics and systems. As a <b>Mechanical Engineer</b>, I was trained to see the world as an intricate set of interconnected parts. I learned to diagnose complex problems, understand how one small inefficiency could impact an entire system, and design solutions that were both elegant and effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I soon realized that the most complex and fascinating systems are not made of gears and circuits; they are made of people. I wanted to understand the why behind the whatâ€”the business strategy that drives the operational decisions. This curiosity led me to pursue my <b>MBA</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            {/* --- THIS IS THE FIX for the ESLint error --- */}
            Through my community leadership as a Deacon and my deep interest in psychology, I have come to believe that a business&apos;s greatest asset and most common point of failure is its people. This led me to write my book, Beyond the Shadow, exploring the intersection of spiritual well-being and psychological resilience.
